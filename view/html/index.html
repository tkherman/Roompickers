It will allow residents to make room selections, look at which rooms are likely to be picked before they can pick, search for the ideal room given a set of preferences, and even flag who their friends are so they can get rooms close by.</div>

                  <div class="panel-body">The room selection process is a hectic and disorganized part of dorm life at Notre Dame. Each dorm has jurisdiction regarding how they want to conduct room picks, but most of them follow a similar procedure: give every resident a room pick number, then get every resident in a common area together at the same time and go in order of room picks, letting people pick the rooms they want. The flaws in this system are now very clear to us, having gone through it multiple times. First off, there is no way of knowing which rooms are going to be available by the time you get to pick, so you have to do a lot of guess work to try to plan what room you want to pick. This is even more painstaking if you have a large group of friends and are trying to get multiple rooms close by. Secondly, if you can’t be there at the one specific time that your pick number is up, then you get the last pick, which translates to the worst room. We propose a solution to all of these problems in the form of a web-app with an intuitive interface that will allow residents to make room selections. With support from dorms, this tool could replace room picks all-together. Residents simply log-in, make room selections over the course of a week, and the information gets sent directly to the residential life office. There is currently no software-based tool available to aid room picks.</div>

We will also store profiles for residents which will include their name and room pick number, as well as profiles for rectors so they can monitor room picks as they happen throughout the week. We will either have the rectors create profiles for their residents, or have the residents create profiles for themselves.</div>

We also plan to leverage Python’s Flask, a micro web framework that will provide us a lightweight solution for CRUD operations on our database and communication between the front-end and back-end. As far as front-end technologies go, we will be keeping it simple with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</div>

We plan to get our data about all of the rooms through the university’s Facility Information office. This office archives floor plan PDFs and CAD drawings for most of the buildings on campus. Parsing the CAD file and or performing some image processing techniques on dorm floor plans should yield the information that we need about a given room. In terms of potential users, we plan to generate tuples of random data using first names, last names, and netIDs, etc. to use for the room selection process. This project focuses on the rooms in dorms across Notre Dame’s campus, and therefore using dummy data for potential users is irrelevant.</div>
